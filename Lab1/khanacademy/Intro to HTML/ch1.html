    <h1> Strawberries and Cigarettes</h1>
    <p> Even if I run away, <br>
        Give my heart a holiday, <br>
        Still strawberries and cigarettes<br>
        Always taste like you. <br>
        You always leave me wanting more, <br>
        I cant shake my hunger for, <br>
        Strawberries and Cigarettes <br> 
        Always taste like you. <br> 
    </p>

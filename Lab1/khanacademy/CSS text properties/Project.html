        <p>I have decided not to be manipulated ever again. I am a free person. I am my only priority. The things she is asking for are hella a lot. Considering my persona, I should not be around such people. I know what healthy is. I thought I could overplay her, but it is just so draining. </p>

        <p> I have decided not to be a slave of my passive behaviour. I can not let life pass by without me noticing, I need to be present to my fullest ability. If its pain, let it enfold me. If it is something unleasant let it enfold me. The thing is I can not use someone as my numbing cream. I need to be my own numbing cream. It is not love. It is self-destrcution to rely on someone to heal my pain. </p>
